   <p>
    Physical Planning refers to the process of managing land and resources to create spaces and environments that are sustainable, functional, and harmonious for human habitation. It involves the arrangement, design, and use of space for various purposes such as residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and infrastructural developments. Physical planning aims to balance development needs with environmental sustainability, community needs, and economic goals.

    Forms of Physical Planning
    </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Master Planning: A long-term plan that guides the development of a city, town, or region. It outlines land use, infrastructure needs, zoning regulations, and environmental considerations. It typically spans several decades and is flexible to accommodate future changes.
    
    <li>Strategic Planning: Focuses on setting goals and priorities for development, often with a longer-term vision (10â€“20 years). Strategic planning is responsive to emerging issues such as economic trends, technological advancements, or environmental concerns.
    
    <li> Action or Implementation Planning: A more specific, short-term planning form that involves the actual steps and actions required to execute a broader strategic or master plan. It often includes detailed projects, budgets, and schedules.
    
    <li>Site Planning: A more granular approach, focusing on the planning of individual sites or properties. It involves designing layouts for buildings, parks, roads, and infrastructure within a specific location.
    
    <li>Participatory Planning: Involves the community in the planning process, allowing stakeholders (residents, business owners, and other local groups) to have a say in how their environment is shaped. It fosters inclusive and democratic planning.
    
    <li>Comprehensive Planning: A holistic approach that takes into account all aspects of development, including land use, transportation, housing, infrastructure, environment, and community needs. It seeks to integrate various planning components into a unified framework.
